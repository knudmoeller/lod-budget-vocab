# Vocabulary for budget data at the level of German federal states

This repository contains a vocabulary for budget data at the level of German federal states, e.g. Einzelbereiche, Gruppe or Funktionen. 
It was created in collaboration between the State Chancellery of Schleswig-Holstein (Staatskanzlei des Landes Schleswig-Holstein) and the Senate Department for Finance (Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Finanzen) in Berlin, and is currently hosted and maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany.

We used [jinjardf](https://github.com/berlinonline/jinjardf) to create this site.

## Future Maintenance
If you have any suggestions or comments, you can open an issue here or contact us via the [OKF-project page](https://okfn.de/projekte/opendata/).<br>
We would also like to see the maintenance of the vocabulary taken over by a governmental actor in the future.
